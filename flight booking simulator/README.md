This project aimed to create a flight booking application in java that would be backed by a PostgreSQL, connected via Java database connectivity (JBDC).

Users would be able to log into an application which would allow them to search flights based on date, duration of flights, start location or end locations, and price ranges. each registered user would also be able to register multiple credit cards to their account, and use any one of them to purchase a flight.

Tools used:
Java, Java swing, SQL, PostgreSQL.
